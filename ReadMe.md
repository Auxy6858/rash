# RASH
A shell program written in Rust

## What is it?
I intend for Rash to be a command line interpreter with all functionality written from the ground up, inspired by projects such as Zsh and Bash, I also intend to reimplement some of the functionality of cmd.exe on unix systems with the end goal being most of the core functionaliy sucessfully, accurately reimplemented. This includes running .bat scripts as well.

## Why?
To learn more about the development of Shell programs, creating interpreters, Rust as well as parsing user input in effective and efficient ways.

I am well aware that any actual rust dev would look at this codebase and cry, this is my first time writing anything in rust so please forgive the substandard quality of code compared to what I'd usually write.
